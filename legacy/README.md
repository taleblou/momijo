# Legacy Implementation

This directory contains the **previous implementation** of the Momijo project.

The code in this folder is preserved **for reference and historical context only**.  
It represents an earlier development phase of the project and is **no longer under active development**.

---

## Status

- 🚫 **Not actively maintained**
- 🚫 **No new features or bug fixes**
- 🚫 **API stability is not guaranteed**
- ✅ Kept for research traceability and backward reference

---

## Current Development

The **active and future development** of Momijo is taking place in the **standard project structure at the repository root**, including:

- `src/`
- `examples/`
- `tests/`
- `docs/`

These directories will host the **new, rewritten, and standardized implementation** that will replace this legacy codebase.

---

## Why this folder exists

This legacy implementation is intentionally kept in the repository to:

- Preserve the project’s development history
- Support reproducibility and research transparency
- Provide context for architectural and API evolution

However, **new users and contributors should not rely on this code**.

---

## Recommendation

If you are looking to:
- use Momijo,
- build on top of it,
- or contribute new features,

👉 **please refer to the root-level implementation**, not the code in this directory.

---

## Notes

- This folder may be removed or archived further in the future.
- No guarantees are made regarding compatibility with upcoming releases.
